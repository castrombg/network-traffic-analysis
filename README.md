# Network Traffic Analysis

Analysis of captured network traffic to identify suspicious behavior and potential security threats using packet inspection techniques.

## Scenario
Network traffic was captured from a workstation after suspicious outbound connections were observed. The capture was reviewed to identify abnormal communication patterns and potential malicious activity.

## What Was Analyzed
- DNS queries
- TCP connections
- HTTP traffic
- Source and destination IP addresses

## Findings
- Repeated outbound connections to unfamiliar external IP addresses
- DNS queries to suspicious domains
- Traffic patterns consistent with beaconing behavior

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- Packet inspection
- Threat identification
